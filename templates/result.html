# Build a flask application that accepts a form submission and presents the submitted data on a results page.
# The goal is to help you get familiar with sending POST requests through a form and displaying that information. 
# http://localhost:5000 - have this display a nice looking HTML form.  The form should be submitted to '/result'
# http://localhost:5000/result - have this display a html with the information that was submitted by POST
# http://localhost:5000/danger - have this redirect back to "/".  Before redirecting back print in the terminal/console a message: "a user tried to visit /danger.  we have redirected the user to /". -->
